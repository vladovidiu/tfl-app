# TFL Underground App

## Approach

The app display the tube lines and their respective status. To see the branches / stations, click on a tile. To go back to the list, click on the header.
After clicking on station, the right side will display the live arrivals for inbound and outbound.

## To do - Improvements

*   Add DLR, Overground, National Rail
*   Unit test - using snapshots
*   Extract logic from similar components -> create more common components
*   Move some components state to app state (selectedLine could be use app wide)
*   Facelift - use semantic ui for layout, but find better looking styles
*   UX process
